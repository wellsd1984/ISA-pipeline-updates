Before running the pipeline for the first time, the script 2_blat_pipeline.pl needs to be initialized using the 
-b and -g commands. This creates a file called ALIGNMENT to hold the paths to blat program and 
your reference genome. One or both can be set at the same time. Running -b or -g again changes
the paths.

2_blat_pipeline.pl -b /path/to/Blat -g /path/to/reference/genome

Analysis steps

1.	Set your working directory to the directory that contains your pair fastq.gz files.
	Copy a settings file template to the folder containing your fastq.gz files. Edit the
	settings file to be specific for your data. See the included example settings file and
	the example below.

2.	Run 1_demultiplex.pl on the command line with your settings file as a 
	command line argument. The demultiplexed data will be printed in a folder for the 3LTR and/or 
	5LTR with the barcodes as the name. A file will be made for each barcode combination that
	has reads that pass the filters.
	
		/path/to/1_demultiplex.pl settings_example.txt

3.	Run 2_blat_pipeline.pl with the path to the debarcoded data files as command line
	arguments. For example, "3LTR/PE1_D505_PE2_D706.txt". Optionally, you can align your
	sequences to a reference HIV genome using the -v command.

		/path/to/2_blat_pipeline.pl -v path/to/virus_ref.fa 3LTR/PE1_D505_PE2_D706.txt 
		
		

Edit the settings file to be specific for your sequencing run.  The example settings file is 
shown below with descriptions. IUPAC codes can be used for ambiguous bases.

	<PE1barcodes> # Enter the LTR primer barcode(s) in this section. Enter one or more depending
	D504		  # on if you want to analyze one LTR, both, and/or check for contamination.
	D505
	<PE2barcodes> # Enter your Linker primer barcode.  The script doesn't check for this barcode
	D706		  # sequence because the MiSeq will have separated by this barcode already.
	<LTR>	# Specify in this section if you want to analyze one LTR or both.
	3LTR
	5LTR
	<3LTR_primer>  # Enter your 3LTR primer sequence.
	CCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATC
	<3LTR_junction> # Enter the last several bases of your 3LTR junction sequence. 
	TCTCTAGCA
	<5LTR_primer>  # Enter your 5LTR primer sequence.
	TGGGAGTGAAYTAGCCCTTC
	<5LTR_junction>  # Enter the last several bases of your 5LTR junction sequence. 
	CCCTTCCA
	<file_name_template> # Enter the name of one of your data files.
	example_MiSeq_data_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
	<pairs> # The number of Read 1 & Read 2 pairs for analysis. 1 per Miseq run but more for HiSeq.
